# 0x0C. Web server
## Introduction
Computers connected to the web are called clients and servers.
* Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
* Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.
In addition to the client and server discussed above, other requirements of a web server includes;
* Internet connection
* TCP/IP
* DNS
* HTTP
* Component files such as code files and assets.
